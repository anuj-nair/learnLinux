# Linux Kernel Fundamentals: Chapter 2, Booting  
	You need to get to the system console. Using virt-manager and a VM is a handy way to do this. 
 
1. Run dmesg and look to see if each output line starts with a time stamp in the form of [     0.1234]. Reboot. From your system console, interrupt GRUB and add the option apic=debug to the kernel line. Continue with the bootup. After booting, log in and see if dmesg output now looks different. Is there now more apic output?Using https://wiki.centos.org/HowTos/Grub2, or another appropriate distro, make a custom GRUB entry that is the same as your current kernelâ€™s entry, but with some changes: 
	 Grub edit before booting `linux 	/boot/vmlinuz...`
	 ``` 
	 apic=debug
	 ```
	 1. Make the title say Custom Linux Boot Entry Experiment. 
	 2. Add the kernel command-line option initcall_debug to the end of the kernel line. 
	 3. For your distro, determine the grub.cfg file to use, and then make a new one with grub2-mkconfig. 
		  For example: grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg 
	 4. Reboot, pick your new GRUB entry, and after it boots, look at /proc/cmdline to see if your kernel command line has initcall_debug. 
			

	 	  Copy the `menuentry` Block from /boot/grub/grub.cfg and create a custom file `<number>_custom` in /etc/grub.d/ then

			```
			grub-mkconfig -o /boot/grub/grub.cfg
			```


2. Interrupt GRUB, and choose your original kernel entry. At the end of the vmlinuz line, add init=/bin/bash and boot. What happened? Turn the power off and on, interrupt GRUB again, and this time, put rdinit=/bin/sh at the end and boot. What happens now? Reset your VM back into your full Linux environment. 
	 Grub edit before booting `linux 	/boot/vmlinuz...`
	 ``` 
	 init=/bin/bash
	 ```
	 or
	 For Ramdisk
	 ```
	 rdinit=/bin/sh
	 ```

3. Is init a link? Does your system have a program called init? Is PID 1 running init? 
   ```
	 ls -l $(which init)
	 ps -ef| grep init
	 ``` 
4. "Rebooting from Custom init" 
	 Grub edit before booting `linux 	/boot/vmlinuz...`
	 ``` 
	 init=/bin/bash
	 ```
	 
5. Using pstree, can you determine which processes are direct descendants of PID 1 including the process running 
	```
	pstree |more
	```
